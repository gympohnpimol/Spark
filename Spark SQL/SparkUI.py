'Caching'
# Unpersists df1 and df2 and initializes a timer

# Run actions on both dataframes

# Prove df1 is cached
print(df1.is_cached)

'Caching: the SQL'
# Unpersist df1 and df2 and initializes a timer
prep(df1, df2) 

# Persist df2 using memory and disk storage level 
df2.persist(storageLevel = pyspark.StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)

# Run actions both dataframes

'Caching and uncaching tables'
# List the tables
print("Tables:\n", spark.catalog.listTables())

# Cache table1 and Confirm that it is cached
spark.catalog.cacheTable('table1')

'Logging'
# Log columns of text_df as debug message
logging.debug("text_df columns: %s", text_df.columns)

# Log whether table1 is cached as info message
logging.info("table1 is cached: %s", spark.catalog.isCached(tableName="table1"))

# Log first row of text_df as warning message
logging.warning("The first row of text_df:\n %s", text_df.first())

# Log selected columns of text_df as error message
logging.error("Selected columns: %s", text_df.select("id", "word"))

'Query plans'
# Run explain on text_df
text_df.explain()

# Run explain on "SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM table1" 
spark.sql("SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM table1").explain()

# Run explain on "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT word) AS words FROM table1"
spark.sql("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT word) AS words FROM table1").explain()
